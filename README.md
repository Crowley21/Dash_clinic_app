## Goals for the DASH App

The DASH app will start with a user login, from there the user will be directed to the dashboard with their own stats over the given time period. The dashboard will have use graphs and target values to present the clinics current data and future goals.

Each clinician will have access to their own stats. There will be an admin user that will have access to all clinicians under different tabs on the dashboard. There will also be a main or clinic tab that will produce a different set of data, to include all clinicians and the clinics stats with projected targets.

The admin will use a separate excel sheet to keep track of targets and projected values to be used.
